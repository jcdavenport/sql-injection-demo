# sql-injection-demo
SQL injection demonstration using Java and Postgresql.

**Must have a current JDBC api configured with your Java IDE to run this demo.




Instructions for initializing the database are in initialize_db.txt

I'm using a postgresql docker container for the database, but any sql database will do.  Just make sure it is accessible from localhost:5432
